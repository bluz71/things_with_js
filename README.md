Simple Javascript Example
=========================

Just a simple example using Javascript.

Currently in the thing show page the count up and down buttons increment
the counter using JS responses; see countup.js.erb and countdown.js.erb.

A "data-behavior" attribute is used to target the counter.

Note, in things.coffee the "ajax:error" event will be listened on in case of
syntax errors in the JS responses.
